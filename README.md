TexturePackMenu
===============

A Spout plugin which forces players to use a server-sanctioned texture pack. They can use the server default, or browse the available texture packs through a menu.

Description
===========

This plugin will override the player's normally chosen texture pack while they are on your server. They will be set to a default texture pack of your choice when they first connect, after which they can choose from a list of available texture packs you have selected. After they choose a different texture pack from your list, their choice will be remembered on subsequent logins.
This will allow you to prevent players from using transparent texture packs to cheat (finding ores and hidden chests easily), and allow players to switch between popular texture packs without leaving the server.

Requires Spout and only works for players using the Spoutcraft client. To require that players use the Spoutcraft client on your server, you can set this option in Spout's config.yml file:
ForceSinglePlayerClient: true
